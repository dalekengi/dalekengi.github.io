I want to take a minute to rite about this pandemic. China played dumb, China lied, and China prevented the WHO from acting in time to save the rest of the world. Thank God for technology or no one would know about this act of war on the entire world. Russia pulled the same cover up, deny deny deny crap with Chernobyl and with anthrax. Only God knows how much China has fucked everyone and got away with it.

God bless and stay safe out there. Work from home!


# What is a Full Stack Developer?
### March 2 2020

A full stack developer is an engineer that works with both front and back ends of an application. We take on projects that involve databases, building user-facing websites, or even work with clients during the planning phase of projects.

### Full stack web developers:

    Are familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and one or more back end languages.
    Most full stack developers specialize in a particular back end programming language, like Ruby or PHP or Python, although some, especially if they’ve been working as a developer for a while, work with more than one. In job listings, you’ll generally see openings for “full stack Ruby developer” or the like.
    Some full stack developers especially in 2019 also learn either project management, visual design, web design, or user experience skills—to complete their “stack” if you will

More and more front and back end are getting mashed together. Forcing developers to take on the mantle of “full stack.” Agencies are looking for developers who know how to work on all the parts of a web app, supposedly so they can use the best tools for the job regardless of whether it’s technically “front end” or “back end.” Causing the number of companies listing full stack development on job requirements to skyrocket.

Now, contrary to what a lot of people think, “full stack” doesn’t necessarily mean a developer is writing all of a site’s code themselves. Many full stack web developers spend the majority of their time in either the front or back end code of a site.

But the point is that they know enough about the code across the entire stack that they can dive in anywhere if needed. And some full stack developers do code entire websites, including both the front and back ends, but usually only if they are working freelance or are the only developer working on a project. Too bad most of the guys wearing the "full stack" title these days aren't qualified.
